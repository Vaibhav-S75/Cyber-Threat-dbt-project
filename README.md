# Cyber-Threat-dbt-project

# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Analytics using dbt + Snowflake

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a production-ready data transformation pipeline using **dbt Cloud and Snowflake** to model and analyze network traffic data for cybersecurity insights.

The goal is to transform raw network stream data into structured dimensional models that support:

- Threat detection analytics  
- Attack category analysis  
- Network traffic behavior monitoring  
- Downstream BI dashboards  

---

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Organizations collect massive volumes of raw network traffic data. However:

- Data is unstructured and inconsistent  
- Attack categories are not standardized  
- No dimensional modeling exists  
- No automated data quality validation is implemented  

This makes it difficult to:

- Identify malicious traffic patterns  
- Analyze attack types  
- Ensure data reliability  
- Support security dashboards  

### ✅ Objective

Build a scalable transformation layer using **dbt** to:

- Clean and standardize raw traffic data  
- Create dimension and fact tables  
- Enforce data quality checks  
- Enable reliable analytics
